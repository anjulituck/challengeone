## Project Description 

####### In this challenge, we had to modify the starter code to focus on an important aspect in web development â€” web acessibility. As requested, a marketing agency, Horiseo, wanted to make the webite meet acessibility standards to opimtize it for search engines. We added alt attributes to the images, semantic elements to the HTML to give more context, added a descriptive text for the title, reviewed the heading order and overall HTML structure.
